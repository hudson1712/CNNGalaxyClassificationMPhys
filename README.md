# Calibrating Rotation Equivariant CNNs for Radio Galaxy Classification
This is a university project built upon the code provided: https://github.com/as595/E2CNNRadGal.
The aim of this project was to calibrate the uncertainties and probabilities of Bayesian deep neural networks for image classification, specifically galaxies as seen in the radio spectrum. The write-up reports detailing the full project and results are here:
